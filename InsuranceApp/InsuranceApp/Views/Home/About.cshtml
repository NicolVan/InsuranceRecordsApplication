    <h2>Insurance Management Application – Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project is a comprehensive <strong>insurance management application</strong> designed to handle policies, insured individuals, and insurance claims efficiently. The system implements <strong>role-based access control</strong> with three main roles: <strong>Client, Agent, and Administrator</strong>, each with specific permissions and visibility:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Client</strong>: Can view only their own policies and claims. Clients can submit new insurance claims and receive email notifications upon submission.</li>
        <li><strong>Agent</strong>: Has access to all clients, policies, and claims. Agents can update the status of insurance claims and receive notifications when clients submit claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Administrator</strong>: Has full system access, including management of users, roles, and permissions. Administrators can filter and monitor all policies and claims and are notified of any new claim submissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The application includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure authentication and authorization</strong>, including login and logout functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Email integration</strong> for registration confirmations, password changes, and claim notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Claim workflow management</strong>, where clients submit claims and only agents or administrators can update their status.</li>
        <li><strong>Data filtering</strong>, enabling administrators and agents to quickly find and review policies, clients, and claims based on various criteria.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This system ensures <strong>data privacy</strong>, clear separation of responsibilities, and transparent claim processing, while providing a professional and user-friendly interface for all roles.</p>
